## Welcome!

I am a software engineer who works primarily with Javascript, React, Node.js, GraphQL, and Postgres. I am also proficient in Typescript, and always looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies.

I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and interested in starting my own business. I'm also committed to financial independence and the concept of retiring early.

On my GitHub profile, you can find some of the projects I have worked on, both personal and professional. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions or comments. Thanks for visiting!
