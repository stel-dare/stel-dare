## Welcome!

I am a software engineer at Revel, where I work primarily with React, Node.js, GraphQL, and Postgres. I am also proficient in Typescript, and I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies.

In addition to my work at Revel, I am passionate about entrepreneurship and am interested in starting my own business. I am also committed to financial independence and the concept of retiring early.

On my GitHub profile, you can find some of the projects I have worked on, both personal and professional. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions or comments. Thanks for visiting!
